## Introduction

### Pythonic Idioms

Pythonic is defined in python.org glossary part as the code which closely follows the most common idioms of the Python language.
Idioms, generally, defined as a phrase that have particular meaning that cannot be directly translate from each word.
Put them together, Pythonic Idiom is is the way to write a set of code to execute particular function by following the principle of Python language.


The idiomatic way of writing code would help on increase efficiency of the code as following figure:

### Why Python?

- Python  programming  language  ranks  in  the  top  three  most  used  by programmers due to [rank by GitHub](https://octoverse.github.com/projects#languages)
- Stack Overflow predicts that it will be the most used in 2020.
- The most active repository on GitHub is “TensorFlow” and it uses Python.

### Why 'with open' statement?

|           Idioms           | # Projects |  Total count  |
|:--------------------------:|:----------:|:-------------:|
|    List   comprehension    |     866    |     75,466    |
|     with      statement    |     848    |    143,453    |
|          Decorator         |     765    |    114,545    |

This table is referenced from the paper [On the Usage of Pythonic Idioms](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/156901/1/paper.pdf)
The data is collected from 1000 example projects in GitHub repository. The collumn numver of projects represents the number of projects that use following Pythonic idiom. Total count means the total number of occurrences of each idiom all over the whole project.


The ‘with open’ is in the 2nd rank but it has the highest number of occurrences so it is selected as the case study of this research.
